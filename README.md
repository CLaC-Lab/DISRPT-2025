# DISRPT 2025 – Task 3 Participation

This repository contains our system submission for Task 3: Discourse Relation Classification in the DISRPT 2025 Shared Task (part of the CODI Workshop @ EMNLP 2025).

We evaluated strong multilingual BERT-based baselines, explored progressive unfreezing strategies, and experimented with zero-/few-shot prompting using Claude Opus 4.0.  
Finally, we introduced a hierarchical adapter + contrastive learning model that surpassed the baselines with significantly fewer trainable parameters.
