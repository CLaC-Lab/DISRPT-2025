# Discourse Relation Classification

Two scripts for classifying discourse relations with Claude Opus 4.0:  
- **zero_shot.py**: zero-shot classification of discourse unit pairs.  
- **few_shot.py**: few-shot classification using English-only or language-specific examples.  

Both save predictions back into the dataset CSV.
